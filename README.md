**Clock Divider in Verilog**
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a clock divider module along with a testbench for simulation and verification. A clock divider is a fundamental digital component that reduces the frequency of an input clock signal by a specified factor. It is commonly used in digital systems where slower clock signals are required for certain operations, peripherals, or subsystems.

The main design file, clk_divider.v, implements a parameterizable clock divider. It takes a high-frequency input clock and a reset signal, and generates a lower-frequency output clock by counting input clock cycles and toggling the output after a fixed interval. The divider factor is determined by a parameter, making it reusable for different clock division needs without modifying the core logic.

The testbench, clk_divider_tb.v, verifies the functionality of the clock divider by simulating different scenarios. It applies a clock and reset sequence, monitors the output clock, and validates its toggling behavior against the expected division ratio. The testbench includes waveform generation support for debugging and visualization purposes during simulation.

This project is compatible with standard Verilog simulators such as Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, or Vivado Simulator. To run a simulation using Icarus Verilog, the user can compile the source and testbench with the command iverilog -o clk_div_test clk_divider.v clk_divider_tb.v, and then execute it using vvp clk_div_test. For waveform viewing, a .vcd file can be generated from the testbench and opened with GTKWave.

This clock divider design is a useful utility for FPGA-based systems, digital controllers, or any logic requiring clock domain scaling. The code is written to be clean and reusable, and it is licensed under the MIT License for open use in both academic and commercial applications.
